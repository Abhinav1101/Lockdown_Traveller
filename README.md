Description:

Railways are the principal mode of transportation for freight and passengers in India. Railways also make it possible to
conduct many activities like business, sightseeing, and pilgrimage along with transportation of goods over longer
distances.Railway passengers are multiplying day by day so the manual system is not at par with the current situation.
